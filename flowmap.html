    <p class="card-text">Justification of Flow Map Design</p>
    <p class="card-text">For my map, I used both a thickness change and color gradient for displaying data flow. In the context of bananas, not only were the liens thickened as banana volume increased, but the lines become darker in orange to depict increased density. I felt this did an appropriate job show flow magnitude. In my choropleth depiction, mapping net ratio involved much smaller numbers and for that reason I came up with 4 good classes using manual breaks to properly depict any major changes in banana net import and export between countries. I felt that white to blue to dark blue was a good choice considering the flow line orange color. The countries with a negative net ratio on bananas implies having more exports than imports, shown in white. I also felt it important to separate countries that had a ratio of greater than 1, which shows a much greater import amount over than total bananas. I decided to add nodes to show individual countries better and also provide a point of reference for the flow lines to converge and diverge from. The size of the node was also a nice way of visualizing the amount of bananas moving in and out. While it is a value that does not tell the full story of things, it is helpful to gauge which countries have the most traffic. I felt that the use of black was a smart choice as it is bold and easily visible.</p>
    <p class="card-text">Flow Map Interpretation</p>
    <p class="card-text">The areas receiving the most flow are Southern South American countries like Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. This makes sense considering the climate for growing bananas is much more favorable in Northern South America due to a more tropical climate there near the equator. Additionally, because of this fact, the majority of banana production heading to Southern countries is coming from Ecuador, Columbia, Bolivia, and Brazil. This is shown through thicker, darker flow lines diverging from their corresponding country. Countries with more production will provide countries with less of the necessary means for production with more goods. These inferences can also be made by their color and their node size. These Northern countries have a much lighter color, almost white, and corresponding to our legend this means that there is little imports of bananas coming into these countries because they are where production takes place. With higher exports, the net ratio for these countries is seen in the negatives. With higher imports, the Southern countries have a more positive net ratio in comparison, and therefore a darker color. The size of the nodes implies high imports, exports, or both, what the legend refers to as net volume. A country like Columbia has a low net volume, because it likely produces most of its bananas due to its location to the equator. This means it is not receiving many imports. Moreover, because countries like Bolivia, and Ecuador are closer to Southern countries in need of imports, it makes more sense to export out of those countries, economically. This is why these two countries as well as their recipients have such large net volumes.</p>
